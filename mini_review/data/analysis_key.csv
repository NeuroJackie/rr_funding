"Chambers, Chris",2019,What's next for Registered Reports?,"""At the journal Cortex, where I serve as an editor, the acceptance rate for Stage 1 RRs that enter in-depth review is about 90%: more than double that of conventional articles. The publication rate at Stage 2 is currently 100%, with no withdrawals by authors."";  I have overseen numerous cases in which reviewers have intervened to prevent a serious flaw in a study design — adding crucial controls, ensuring the sample size is sufficient or explaining why the hypotheses or planned statistical analyses cannot really answer the research question. Even when a proposed design is sound, the review process often adds clarity and focus. In my experience, the reviewers find the process rewarding. One comment from a reviewer is typical of the informal feedback I receive: “If the authors can incorporate many of the suggestions from all of us reviewers, they will have a far better study than what they originally planned, which is really valuable and exciting. ; ""They cannot wait two to four months for a Stage 1 manuscript to complete peer review""; y."" RRs are popular with early-career researchers. For example, at Cortex, 78% of RR first authors (n=82) are PhD students or postdocs, compared with 67% in a control sample (n=57) of conventional articles. ""; ""Over the past six years, dozens of authors have told me —and written publicly — that they appreciate the more-predictable timeline of RRs"";  ""Stage 2 submissions almost always include further analyses.""; ""In my experience, the opposite [to people being locked into a bad protocol] is more likely: reviewers can prevent researchers from running less-informative experiments""; ""reviewers of Stage 2 manuscripts generally understand reasonable changes.""",,"IPA = authors don't need to present clean, compelling narrative of results; ""s. I hope RRs will become an option in all mainstream life- and social-science journals within ten years""; reviewers can improve the design; IPA benefits students b/c they can list publication earlier & more certainly than traditional submissions; shorter total time to publication b/c resubmission & requests of additional studies less likely; prevents researchers leaving reasonable & questionable changes unreported; prevents selective analysis reporting & HARKing","Unsuitable for non-hypothesis driven & methods development research; RRs ""intended only to strengthen the rigour and transparency"" of hypothesis-driven research BUT researchers must wait for IPA before collection = unsuitable if researchers can't wait (e.g. unpredicatble events or undergrad projects) or  ; RR are suitable for sequential studies where design depends on each others results BUT authors rarely do this maybe b/c multiple rounds of pre-study review is too time consuming instead authors submit a follow-up study to a series or submit a plan for the entire series; concern less flexible = constrains creativity & serendipity from data exploration BUT not true b/c unplanned analyses welcome; concern it locks researchers into adhering to poor quality protocol BUT this rarely happens (see empirical_pro); if journals publish Stage 2 manuscripts only readers can't compare it with protocol",,preprint (https://osf.io/5y8w7/) finds RRs are cited the same amount or higher than traditional articles,include_key
