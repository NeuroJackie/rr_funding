By this point it is too late to alter the flawed design because the data already have been collected. In some cases, this leads to the study being rejected for publication altogether, in which case the authors have wasted considerable time, resources, and effort. Research subjects also may have been exposed to potentially harmful (or at least nonbeneficial) interventions for nothing. In other cases, authors, having been rejected by a “flagship” journal, will resubmit the paper to a different journal that is perceived to be less selective.The paper is once more sent out for peer review, encumbering another panel of reviewers and their expertise, thus creating more work for all involved, including reviewers and editors. If the paper is eventually deemed to be publishable, it is certain that the authors will need to add extensive discussion of the study’s flaws to the “Limitations” section of the manuscript.
