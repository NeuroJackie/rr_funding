Searched Web of Science (WoS) with the syntax shown in this image on 7 Oct 2019 and exported 'Full Record' of all records as an 'Other Reference Software' file format

WoS export

# 02_exported_screened_rr_results

1. Imported 01 file into new Zotero group library. 
2. Screened all records. 
3. Excluded records if they (1) did not refer to registered reports (using any term) (2) did reference registered reports but did not discuss RRs beyond defining or describing the RR process (3) did not have a valid doi (4) had a full-text could not be accessed. 
4. Screened records were tagged as 'exclude' or 'include'. 
5. When screen was complete I exported all records from Zotero as a BibTeX file.

# 03_rr_zotero_export.csv

copied all text referencing RRs to a note - if the article contained vast amounts no text was exported to a Zotero note. 
Articles with a note were assigned the tag 'noted'

## Columns

* default Zotero CSV export fields

# 03_inc_citekeys.csv

1. Default csv export format at the time did not export the citekey field so KD created a new Zotero csv translator (CSV_better). 
CSV_better format exports the same fields as the default CSV export plus the `Citekey` field which contains the citation key generated by the Zotero add-on "Better BibTex"
2. Included articles were exported from Zotero into a csv with their citekeys using the customised CSV_better export option

## Columns

* CSV_better fields = default CSV fields plus the `Citekey` field
