(2014) suggested that the foremost
concern of researchers with publishing reforms such as open data, preregistration, and registered reports is the possibility of getting “scooped” (see Gewin, 2016; Peters et al., 2012; Van Noorden, 2014) by losing priority access to one’s own data. That is, once data, materials, or study plans are posted publicly, future use of those data and plans are as open to others as to the researcher who  actually conceptualized the study and collected the data; Additional concerns include...adherence to preregistered plans stifling exploration and discovery (though preregistration does not disallow exploratory research; it just requires that it not be presented as confirmatory research; Miguel et al., 2014; Moore, in press),",psychology; replication; publication bias; credibility; file drawer; registered reports; include; social-sciences; note; randomized controlled-trials; post; science research,
