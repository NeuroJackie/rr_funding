"<p>In addition to our standard Research Articles, we are pleased to announce three new categories of articles: Replications, Registered Reports, and Null Results. In joining other journals in psychology and related fields to offer these publication types, we hope to promote higher standards of methodological rigor in our science. This will ensure that our discoveries are based on sound evidence and that they provide a durable foundation for future progress.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>We will accept submission of articles as Registered Reports (Chambers, 2013; Chambers, Forstmann, &amp; Pruszynski, 2017), which will be reviewed for significance and methodological approach, at a point in time before the study has actually been carried out. A decision of provisional acceptance can then be rendered before the study is actually done, so that publication of the full report does not depend on the outcome of the study. This is meant to encourage formulation of study hypotheses before data are collected, preventing p-hacking and HARKing, as well as scrutiny of power and experimental design at a point in time when these can be adjusted in response to peer review. Moreover, this mode of publication is meant to discourage selective publication of positive or â€œflashyâ€ results, which may distort the research literature. This is because the decision whether to publish or not is made before the data are obtained, so evaluation of the importance of the article to the field is based on the research question rather than the outcome.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>We argue that the publication of registered reports, replications, and null results can result in positive advances as well as guard against the important problem of publication bias. Publication bias arises when the outcome of a study influences whether the author decides to publish. Decisions not to publish high quality research because of the direction or strength of the outcome can distort a body of literature and impede the ability to integrate evidence. The quality of the research, however, is key. Thus, for these three new categories of articles, we will consider the quality of the study methodology as well as the importance of the findings to the field when making publication decisions. In joining other journals in psychology and related fields in offering these publication formats, we hope that we can contribute to the growing movement to promote high standards of methodological rigor in our science, ensuring that our discoveries are based on sound evidence. We welcome feedback from our authors and readers as we develop these new modes of publication, and we continue to look forward to receiving articles describing your exciting work.</p>","Baxter, Mark G.; Burwell, Rebecca D.","HARKing; p-hacking; publication bias; negative results; include; announcement_RRs; mpte; note; scientific   method"
"<p>The decision to include such reports was driven by a desire to support transparent research practices and to support testing the reproducibility of important and influential empirical findings. The format affords authors the opportunity to conduct and publish their research projects whether or not the findings ultimately achieve community- and methodologically expected levels of significance. To date, most registered reports appearing in journals have involved attempts at replication, although clearly other types of projects might also be viable.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>Â </p>","Rapp, David N.","include; announcement_RRs; note"
"<p>The journal will then decide whether to offer in principle acceptance (IPA) of the study. This means that, if the authors of the registered reports conduct the study per the approved protocol, the journal guarantees publication of the finished article. The need to obtain statistically significant results to be published is therefore removed. Instead, researchers are incentivized to execute a high-quality realization of the registered reports, knowing that the reward will be a publication.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>The advantages of registered reports for the scientific literature are clear, since results obtained from preregistered analyses cannot be easily gamed. However, there are also benefits for other stakeholders. Researchers can feel more confident in the validity of their results, and are less likely to be fooled into performing fruitless follow-on studies based on artefactual effects. Prospective peer review also means that their work will be judged based on their ability to identify and answer an important research question, rather than on whatever that answer turns out to be. Moreover, peer review of a detailed protocol may result in improvements to the study, where these are practicable within the bounds set out by the ethical approval. Benefits to journals include the fact that published results are far less likely to be exposed as artefacts. Both journals and peer-reviewers are given the opportunity to suggest alterations to the design of the study, and in this way, might forestall missed opportunities. Ultimately, patients are likely to benefit from more rigorous evaluations of reproductive medical interventions than are currently performed. Considering these advantages, Fertility&amp;Sterility is introducing the registered reports format for randomized controlled trials.</p> <p>We believe that this format, by emphasizing rigorous methodology over surprise and spin, will produce high quality research that will stand the test of time.</p> <p>Â </p>","Wilkinson, Jack; Pellicer, Antonio; Niederberger, Craig","include; announcement_RRs; note"
"<p>To examine whether links can be evidenced, the present research applied the registered reports methodology to bring a novel and rigorous empirical lens to a scientific literature sharply divided on the effects of violent video games</p> <p>Â </p> <p>we observed at least three such correlations ranging in size from when considering uncorrected models using variables we did not hypothesize would be correlated with aggressive behaviour.... If we had not preregistered our empirical approach and felt motivated to publish a positive result we might have seized on this correlation and made it the central focus of our research report. This possibility, capitalizing on chance, underlines the value of the registered reports framework for documenting the hypothesis generation and testing process and formalized data-driven approaches for exploratory data analysis such as specification curve analysis [83]. In isolation, a cherry-picked result such as this might add undue weight to the moral panic surrounding electronic gaming. Study preregistration and registered reports act as bulwark against drawing such post hoc inferences.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>This is among the first studies to test the effects of violent gaming on human aggression using a preregistered hypothesis-testing framework and the first to do so following the registered reports protocol. The results provide confirmatory evidence that violent video game engagement, on balance, is not associated with observable variability in adolescentsâ€™ aggressive behaviour. A healthy ecosystem of exploratory and registered research reports will enable scientists to conduct metanalytic research to evaluate the inferences drawn from these methodologies. Only then will we be able to examine the pathways by which aggressive play might relate to real-world aggression in novel, incremental and empirically robust ways. With this evidence in hand, we will be able to judge if the attention and resources allocated to this topic, spent at the expense of other important questions of the digital age, is empirically justified.</p>","Przybylski, Andrew K.; Weinstein, Netta","include; note"
"<p>The Registered Report format encourages authors to think more carefully about study design, analysis, and interpretation and thereby promotes better scientific practice.</p> <p>in an ideal world such experiment justification would be part of the majority of scientific reports; in this regard the introduction and methods sections of a Registered Report format should be little different from regular submissions.In practice, we find that very few current manuscripts provide adequate justification for the reported experimental design. More often, the justification that an experiment is adequate is based on the finding that the data show the anticipated effect. Assuming authors are being honest and fully reporting their findings, such data contingent justification appears to be partly based on luck, which does not seem viable for the progress of science over the long term. Of course, luck will always be a part of scientific work (if for no other reason than that experiments depend on a random sample), but the Registered Report format should motivate scientists to design experiments that remove the need for it.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>Of course, in principle it would be difficult to know whether the submitting authors have already gathered their data and now simply play a game called â€œRegistered Reportsâ€. However, we believe in the integrity of researchers and we feel it is likely that authors would use traditional submission formats with data already at hand â€“ indeed, we suspect many authors will greatly improve their experimental design based on reviewer feedback, which would render any already gathered data moot. The Registered Report format is not a cure-all for scientific practice. It is possible for a Registered Report to contain poor science, and it is possible for excellent science to be done without a Registered Report. In an ideal world, every article would include proper justification for experimental design, data collection, measurement, and analysis. For a variety of reasons, that kind of justification is not common in the present state of the field. We anticipate that the Registered Report format will encourage development and description of such justifications so that they become the norm for scientific reporting.</p>","Francis, Gregory; Bachmann, Talis","include; announcement_RRs; note"
"<p>With this format[RR], acceptance in principle happens before the research outcomes are known. As a result, publication bias is neutralized, as are incentives for practices that undermine the validity of scientific research.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>Nature Human Behaviour is committed to supporting robust scientific practices and the adoption of the registered report format is one step in this direction.

Some have questioned whether the format curtails creativity and the exploration of serendipitous findings4. However, this is by no means the case: although authors are required to adhere to the accepted protocol, there are no restrictions on the reporting of unplanned, unregistered analyses. We only ask that unregistered analyses be flagged as such, so that readers can discriminate between pre-registered and unregistered analyses. We further offer incremental registration (with fast-track peer review), so that authors have the option to add experiments to approved submissions. This is particularly appropriate in cases where an initial experiment leads to a serendipitous finding that warrants follow-up in the same paper. The registered report format is not suitable for all types of research and we will be offering it alongside our other research formats. However, we strongly encourage those scientists engaged in hypothesis-driven quantitative research to consider submitting their work as a registered report â€” there is nothing to lose, but much to gain.</p>","Anonymous","include; announcement_RRs; note"
"<p>One relatively new initiative, which aims to enhance integrity and combat the risks of publication bias in scientific journals, has been the emergence of registered reports</p> <p>This represents a significant change of direction from the conventional and timeâ€tested approach to publishing and reviewing. Initially developed by the Center of Open Science, this initiative has the potential to enhance rigour of the research and deal with potential sources of publication bias. Several healthâ€related disciplines, including neuroscience and psychology, have already launched registered reports within their academic journals. Within themselves, registered reports may not completely resolve risks of scientific publication bias in research. However, with each published registered report it is envisaged that scientific rigour will be enhanced, giving encouragement to other researchers to embrace this innovative approach towards best practice in dissemination of their research.</p> <p>For the sceptic, the launch of registered reports may appear to place a greater burden the author, with one more step in the publication workflow; however, the twoâ€step Journal of Clinical Nursing procedure outlined in the next section of this editorial reveals a relatively straightforward process. [standard description of RR process]</p> <p>Â </p> <p>Although this process will change the publication workload for some nurse researchers, change will potentially bring with it additional benefits. A wellâ€reviewed registered report may clarify potential distinctions between confirmatory and exploratory research and has the potential to enhance the planning process for the experimental researcher, and at some point in the research process, every author needs to address all of the required research steps, regardless of the mode of publication. Perhaps the most tangible benefit for individual researchers from taking the registered report route to publication is to have their manuscripts accepted, in principal, prior to knowing the findings. In addition, it could be argued that providing feedback earlier in the process may allow for correction of any methodological matters prior to commencing the study, potentially improving the research rigour of the published paper. It may also be argued that this process may enhance the impact of the research leading to more citations. Enhancing the integrity of research, the registered report may also act to counteract post hoc hypothesising, lack of data sharing and a paucity of replication studies.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>In experimental and translational nursing research, this exciting new initiative moves the decision to publish towards the quality of work, as opposed to the final study outcomes. In line with other highâ€quality biomedical journals, Journal of Clinical Nursing encourages the submission of registered reports. We believe that registered reports will offer the proactive researcher with a means to enhance and demonstrate the transparency and reproducibility of their work</p> <p>Â </p> <p>Moving the goalposts of the primary review to before data has been collected has the potential, providing it meets predetermined criteria, to ensure that the bestâ€quality studies are published regardless of findings, reducing the issues commonly associated with publication bias. As such, registered reports provide a good fit to enhance the transparency of interventional studies, which can only be a good thing for translational nursing research. They will also allow our readers to be more confident about the reproducibility of a study. Although not a oneâ€shot fix for all publishing issues, registered reports provide a clear movement in the right direction, ensuring best practice throughout the entire publication process.</p> <p>Â </p>","Smith, Graeme D.; Penny, Kay I.","include; announcement_RRs; note"
"<p>When considered together, the present study and replication attempt cast doubt on the replicability of the original study. This is for three major reasons...The third reason is that the present study was fully preregistered, while our original study was not. Because all primary analyses and exclusion criteria were determined before data collection took place, the present study had few experimenter degrees of freedom that could have inflated the rate of false positives. In contrast, our original study had undisclosed flexibility in statistical analyses, exclusion criteria, and the content of hypotheses, increasing the chance that at least some of those positive findings were false. Indeed, several procedures in the original study lacked details or explicit justification, giving us the opportunity to inadvertently adjust data in support of our hypotheses. For example, we did not justify log-transforming commission error rates before correlating them with DERN amplitudes, and did not perform this same transformation for error rates when they were compared across groups. Inconsistent transformation procedures without explicit justification are not evidence of phacking, but do reveal the analytic flexibility that was available to us in our statistical procedures at the time.</p>","Elkins-Brown, Nathaniel; Saunders, Blair; Inzlicht, Michael","Replication; reliability; false discovery rate; motivation; Anxiety; include; performance; punishment; brain activity; ern; note; anterior cingulate; anxiety; Emotion; Misattribution; responsiveness"
"<p>One proposed solution intended to improve the quality of published research is the Registered Reports model ... In contrast to conventional research articles, publishing decisions for Registered Reports are based on the importance of the research question and the methods proposed to answer that question. Critically, this decision is made before data collection has begun. This has the important advantage of reducing opportunity and incentives for biased research practices (eg, leveraging analytical flexibility to achieve statistical â€œsignificanceâ€), raising standards of methodological disclosure and statistical power, and avoiding publication bias (by offering in principle acceptance before the results are known).</p>","Munafo, Marcus R.","include; nicotine; note; announcement_funder_rr_partnership; funder_rr_partnerships; tobacco research"
"<div data-canvas-width=""576.1173600000001"">This new submission category [RR] is designed to provide researchers with a route to investigate controversial topics and address issues of replication and reproducibility</div> <div data-canvas-width=""576.1173600000001""> <div data-canvas-width=""495.2642399999998"">Inviting Registered Reports is one of several steps that the journal is taking to acknowledge changes in the landscape of scientific publishing (see Pexman, 2017). We are also interested in providing a formal mechanism for scientists to engage in principled, productive, and positive exchanges when discussing con-troversial problems, such as issues of replication and reproducibility. Thus, if an author wants to examine the reproducibility of a published experiment, that author should prepare the manuscript as if the journal will invite an author of the original paper to serve as a reviewer. Given that practice, we expect that authors who submit Registered Reports that investigate the reproducibility of a published experiment will (a) treat the work that they want to address with a professional attitude, (b) treat the researchers who published the original work with respect, and (c) present their motivations and conclusions in a productive and constructive manner</div> </div>","Jamieson, Randall K.; Bodner, Glen E.; Saint-Aubin, Jean; Titone, Debra","include; announcement_RRs; note"

"<p>pre-evaluation [of RRs] has two main advantages: 1. It provides useful feedback to authors before they start performing the experiments. In that way, the project can be greatly improved. This ultimately saves time and money. I would personally enjoy feedback from peers at very early stages of a project, as one cannot always see potential caveats, or better ways to demonstrate what we want to show. External advice is always important. 2. It guarantees publication, again saving time, as the study is already provisionally accepted.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>From personal experience, I know that it is sometimes impossible to predict how a project will exactly evolve in time. This is the nature of science. However, in some instances, the experimental plan can be straightforward, like for preclinical studies.

"<p>RR has advantages for researchers, particularly those at the start of their careers, who can benefit from critical input at the formulation stage of the work and be assured of inâ€principle publication, driven by the quality and importance of the research, rather than the outcome. The process of registration and the necessary steps are set out in detail on the ACP website: www.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/acp.

"<p>An interesting new development (with old roots [De Groot, A.D. The meaning of â€œsignificanceâ€ for different types of research [translated and annotated by Eric-Jan Wagenmakers, Denny Borsboom, Josine Verhagen, Rogier Kievit, Marjan Bakker, Angelique Cramer, Dora Matzke, Don Mellenbergh, and Han L. J. van der Maas]. Acta Psychol. 2014, 148, 188â€“194. [CrossRef] [PubMed]]) is the registered report [101]. In this publishing format, the review concerns the registration rather than the final research article, allowing reviewers to catch potential errors and oversights in the formulation of the hypotheses as well as to make recommendations to improve the design at precisely the right moment.Â  If the data collection goes according to plan, the article is published regardless of whether the results are positive or not. Hence, registered reports focus on the a priori methodological and substantive quality of the study rather than on the niceness of the results. Hence registered reports also help counter publication bias. Although traditional grant review also involves peer review of research plans, plans in grant proposals are often not sufficiently detailed to reveal biases during the actual research process and in the later (non-) publication of results. Therefore, it would be much more efficient to use registered reports in a format in which the grant review and publication decisions are combined and focused on the specific registration of a study [102].</p>","Wicherts, Jelte M.","psychology; replicability; reproducibility; confirmation bias; publication bias; meta-research; p-values; include; recommendations; registered-reports; clinical-trials; note; citation bias; consort   statement; questionable research   practices; randomized controlled-trials; validity"
"; <p>For example, another step for increasing rigor that is highlighted in other articles within this special issue (Baldwin, 2017; Cohen, 2017) is the need for increased publication ofÂ  registered reports, which require reporting of sample size calculations in the initial submission. It continues to seemthat journals implicitly require results that are statistically significant in order to be accepted for publication, but this trend of only publishing significant findings is decreasing with the advent of registered reports. Therefore, the combination of registering a study in addition to reporting a priori sample size calculations may reduce the probability of obtaining false findings. However, no primary electrophysiology/psychophysiology journals had introduced registered reports at the time of this writing (for a listing of journals that include registered reports please see https://osf.io/8mpji/wiki/home/). That said, the International Journal of Psychophysiology (journal of this special issue) now includes a submission option for registered reports (as of April 2016).

"<p>Preregistration also allows researchers to change their research plans (e.g., if one learns about a better statistical analysis), as long as these changes are well motivated and transparently communicated. This is true even for registered reportsâ€”a publication format in which peer review of planned studies occurs before the research is conducted, and potential acceptance for publication does not depend on study outcomes (Chambers, 2013; Nosek &amp; Lakens, 2014; vanâ€™t, Veer, &amp; Giner-Sorolla, 2016)â€”in open and honest dialogue with the editors and reviewers.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>when researchers encounter unexpected setbacks or, for that matter, opportunities (e.g., testing conditions are different from what was anticipated or change during testing), they can take notes of decisions they have to make â€œon the fly,â€ as many already do, and report these decisions in manuscripts or supplemental materials. It is of paramount importance that such transparency in planning and reporting is then rewarded by editors and reviewers, grant panels, and hiring committees.These evaluators must be sensitive to the myriad challenges faced by researchers working in hard-to-control settings. If they are not, the new practices could crucially disadvantage these valuable areas of psychological science. This problem is not entirely new, of course. In the present discourse, too, cross-cultural or field researchers face special challenges in the review process (e.g., inevitably working with small sample sizes, replication studies taking 4 years instead of 4 weeks).

"<p>journals are adopting the Registered Reports publishing format52,53 to encourage pre-registration and add results-blind peer review (see Box 3).</p> <p>There are promising examples of effective interventions for nudging incentives. For example, journals are adopting badges to acknowledge open practices (Fig. 2), Registered Reports as a results-blind publishing model (see Box 3) and TOP guidelines to promote openness and transparency.</p> <p>Box 3. The Registered Reports (RR) initiative seeks to eliminate various forms of bias in hypothesis-driven research52,53, and in particular,the evaluation of a study based on the results. By accepting articles before results are known, RRs prevent publication bias. By reviewing the hypotheses and analysis plans in advance, RRs should also help neutralize P-hacking and HARKing (hypothesizing after the results are known) by authors, and CARKing (critiquing after the results are known) by reviewers with their own investments in the research outcomes, although empirical evidence will be required to confirm that this is the case.Perhaps the most commonly voiced objection to RRs is that the format somehow limits exploration or creativity by requiring authors to adhere to a pre-specified methodology. However, RRs place no restrictions on creative analysis practices or serendipity. Authors are free to report the outcomes of any unregistered exploratory analyses, provided such tests are clearly labelled as post hoc. Thus, the sole requirement is that exploratory outcomes are identified transparently as exploratory (for a list of frequently asked questions see https://cos.io/rr/#faq). Of course, RRs are not intended for research that is solely exploratory.The concept also opens the door to alternative forms of research funding that place a premium on transparency and reproducibility. For example, authors could submit a detailed proposal before they have funding for their research. Following simultaneous review by both the funder and the journal, the strongest proposals would be offered financial support by the funder and in-principle acceptance for publication by the journal (https://cos.io/rr/#funders).</p> <p>Table 1.

"<p>At the center of our onion model would be a process that can make use of all previous layers, while adding an additional layer of transparency in that it allows reviewers unprecedented access to an authorâ€™s early stages of research planning.

Notably, Communication Research Reports currently accepts stage one preregistered reports as one of five submission types to the journal but does not have a requirement for authors to make their stage one materials publicly available. Such an approach has been critiqued as a weakness of the preregistration process (Hardwicke &amp; Ioannidis, in press), as without publicly sharing stage one materials, readers are unable to assure that the published manuscripts strictly adhered to the accepted stage one protocols. For this reason, CRR would strongly recommend authors submitting preregistered reports to consider sharing materials online in coordination with CRR editors.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>With exception of stage one preregistered reports (which require authors to submit preliminary documents that might not be part of their standard research process), peeling back at least some of the layers around research requires a nominal amount of additional effort on behalf of currently practicing researchers</p> <p>Â </p> <p>The two-step review process requires additional academic labor, in particular on the behalf of reviewers, and some argue that simply engaging in additional rounds of peer review does little to correct existing critiques of peer review processes (Dâ€™Andrea &amp; Oâ€™Dwyer, 2017).

In the current peer-review process, which evaluates completed projects, it is often the case that reviewers identify major shortcomings in a studyâ€™s design or instrumentation that allow for alternative explanations of the findings. By this point it is too late to alter the flawed design because the data already have been collected. In some cases, this leads to the study being rejected for publication altogether, in which case the authors have wasted considerable time, resources, and effort. Research subjects also may have been exposed to potentially harmful (or at least nonbeneficial) interventions for nothing. In other cases, authors, having been rejected by a â€œflagshipâ€ journal, will resubmit the paper to a different journal that is perceived to be less selective. The paper is once more sent out for peer review, encumbering another panel of reviewers and their expertise, thus creating more work for all involved, including reviewers and editors. If the paper is eventually deemed to be publishable, it is certain that the authors will need to add extensive discussion of the studyâ€™s flaws to the â€œLimitationsâ€ section of the manuscript. The paper ends up contributing less value to the literature than the authors had hoped because, in the final analysis, the evidence for the studyâ€™s central claims is weak. By addressing these potential issues up front, we believe that the registered reports format offers a more humane process for researchers and reviewers. Peer review of the studyâ€™s methodology occurs at a point in the process when changes can actually be made, not after it is too late. The specific editors and reviewers working on a registered report may shoulder a larger burden of the work, but this work is concentrated only on those individualsâ€”not the other sets of potential reviewers who will be encumbered as the article is â€œshopped aroundâ€ to different journals. The adoption of registered reports will help avoid putting reviewers and editors in the difficult position of telling their colleagues that a study is doomed and that effort was wasted. Through registered reports, reviewers also avoid being placed in the unenviable position of second-guessing a studyâ€™s purported claims (e.g., â€œthereâ€™s no way that effect size can be so large!â€) due to unprovable suspicions about the use of QRPs. At the time of this writing (November, 2017), 80 journals (for an updated list, see https://cos.io/ rr/#journalsâ€”Gifted Child Quarterly was the 71st!) are now accepting registered report submissions, and the list is growing on a weekly basis. We hope that all the gifted education journals will soon appear on this list.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>Here are several simple steps that journals can take to move toward more open practices: Allow authors to submit research for review before the results are known via the registered reports format. Very little of the review process would need to change to do this. Reviewers would not be influenced by whether or not the findings were supportive of a particular agenda, or by whether they were statistically significant. Moreover, authors would get feedback on their method and analysis plans at a time when they can ethically alter these plans</p>","McBee, Matthew T.; Makel, Matthew C.; Peters, Scott J.; Matthews, Michael S.","reproducibility; HARKing; preregistration; replication; replication crisis; p-hacking; publication bias; open materials; open data; registered reports; citations; questionable research practices (QRPs); registered report; include; note; file   drawer; open   science; psychological-science"
"<p>A mechanism that aims to address these problems[?], as well as to increase the amount and quality of replication, is the article type referred to as Registered Reports (see Marsden et al., 2018).</p> <p>Â </p> <p>in-principle acceptance incentivizes researchers to undertake a replication by reassuring them with a pledge of publication prior to investing in the data collection.</p> <p>It is unsurprising, therefore, that to date Registered Reports include a high proportion of replication studies (see the list at Center for Open Science, 2017), relative to the proportions found in standard publication routes as observed in the current and previous studies. Indeed, journals that offer Registered Reports as a route to publishing replication research meet the highest level (Level 3) of the TOP Guidelines on replication. Thus, Registered Reports have the potential to address many of the observations in our synthesis, including (a) few replications of studies with null findings, (b) low rate of publication of replications overall, (c) lack of direct replications, (d) extensive and unacknowledged heterogeneity between initial and replication studies, and (e) associations between supportiveness of replicationsâ€™ findings and author overlap or materials availability. Registered Reports also carry other benefits: (a) they allow peer review to inform the study at the design stage (rather than when it can be too late to improve the study); (b) they reduce questionable research practices; and (c) they accommodate any methods where data collection, coding, and analyses can be predetermined (e.g., including observations and interviews). Importantly, there is also potential to adapt the procedure to fit uniquely to exploratory designs and associated epistemologies in Exploratory Reports (McIntosh, 2017).

"<p>The registered report process guided our execution and enhanced reliability in two ways. First, it encouraged us to conduct a natural field experiment design, which provided us with significant advantages. We were able to draw causal inferences, thanks to the random selection of our treatment store-brands, and we could examine the effects of an ISSC in a natural context (Bandiera, Barankay, and Rasul [2011], Floyd and List [2016]). Furthermore, because our study was a natural field experiment, subjects were unaware that they were participating in a study. Thus, we avoided selfselection and could discard â€œHawthorne effectâ€ alternative explanations. Second, before executing our field experiment, we submitted a registered report proposal in which we committed to conducting a specific set of analyses to test our main hypotheses and delve into the tradeoffs underlying those hypotheses. Having made this commitment, we neither restated our hypotheses nor conducted any unplanned analyses except for expanding the â€œAdditional Analysesâ€ in the accepted proposal from analyzing financial outcomes to analyzing all of our three stated outcomes of interest and conducting various robustness tests. Our hypotheses were articulated based on theory instead of ex post facto rationalization of results and our analyses were based on a carefully crafted research design (refined through multiple rounds of reviews) rather than on data mining.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>30We appreciate the registered report process as it is especially supportive of projects like ours: field experiments in real organizations that could address important and relevant research questions but are costly and risky to implement. The discipline enforced by this review process helped us adhere to the original study design and enabled us to carry out this experiment in the face of unanticipated difficulties. We also appreciate the early feedback that we received before conducting our field experiment, which led to a higher quality and more powerful study.</p>","Li, Shelley Xin; Sandino, Tatiana","design; creativity; productivity; field experiments; include; selection; impact; note; authority; engagement; generation; geographically dispersed   organizations; idea; information sharing systems; integration; knowledge sharing; labor management; learning; organizations; retail chains"

This confluence of events may make this time an ideal one for publishing through research partnerships. One of the caveats of conducting organizational research is the fear of null results, particularlywith quasi-experimental or observational designs, shortened measures, and imperfect real-world criteria.

Nosek and Lakens argued that registered reports avoid the problem of editors and reviewers preferring findings that are statistically significant and congenial to the existing research record.

We acknowledge that up till now limited options were available to preregister non-medical research. Currently though suitable alternatives are widely available, either in the form of open-access repositories such as the Open Science Framework (https:// cos.io/our-products/open-science-framework) or Dataverse (https://dataverse.org/), or in the form of so-called Âªregistered reportsÂº format</p>","Kal, Elmar; Prosee, Rens; Winters, Marinus; van der Kamp, John","include; registered-reports; metaanalysis; note; acquisition; analogy; attentional focus; automaticity; errorless; know-how; memory   processes; task-performance"

"<p>Our working hypothesis was that scholars simply perceived the risks too high and the net benefits too low. With this hypothesis in hand, the Reviewâ€™s editorial team brainstormed ways in which we could shift the perceived risk away from the scholars to us as editors. One potential risk-shifting mechanism we identified was Registered Reports (RRs), a new peer-reviewed editorial protocol developed in the cognitive sciences.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>The promulgators of RRs argue they eliminate the disincentives for authors to publish negative or â€œnon-â€ results, better complying with the spirit of the scientific method and thus ameliorating publication bias. Many fields of scientific inquiry are tailored to the production of positive results and not the production of objective, well-executed research, they argue. Opponents of RRs argue that conditional pre-acceptance of a paper limits post hoc exploratory analysis that is inherently organic in research, as an experimental procedure is often revealed to be flawed after results are tabulated.3 There are other criticisms of RRs, such as the fact that they create incentives for scholars to fish for positive secondary results by selecting among the most favorable post hoc outcomes for their paper to boost citations</p> <p>Weighing these pros and cons of RRs, the Reviewâ€™s editorial team believed the core element of RRs, that authors are offered in-principle acceptance before final results are known, could be just the incentive needed to draw out hesitant scholars who might be inclined to take on a new research project on FinTech. It was imperative to follow a competitive process by which proposals would be evaluated, and with this in mind, we recruited a distinguished scientific review committee to help us. To manage the potential risk that scholars would retrofit a completed paper as an â€œas-ifâ€ proposal, we initiated a very short timeline for the proposals to be submitted.</p> <p>Figure 1 -Timeline of the RFS FinTech Registered Reports editorial protocol</p>","Goldstein, Itay; Jiang, Wei; Karolyi, G.

"<p>The second possible solution [to publication bias] is pre-registration of rationale, research design, and methods prior to experimentation [they confuse prereg for RRs]</p> <p>Â </p> <p>Variations of this publication model [RRs] are growing rapidly in different fields, including medicine,45 psychology,44 and neuroscience.41 Notably, there are early signs of preregistration in the exercise sciences.46 This model has several clear benefits. First, scientists do not feel as pressured to report positive results, provided they follow their proposal. Second, pre-registration reduces the so-called â€œresearcherâ€™s degrees of freedomâ€, or the decision on how to analyze the data both before and after the data collection phase, which allows scientists to implement an analysis that favors the positive, rather than â€˜nonsignificantâ€™ or trivial results.33 Third, by committing to an analysis beforehand, the effects of various biased practices, such as HARKing or P hacking, should be reduced substantially.41 Finally, the number of â€˜non-significantâ€™ or trivial results in clinical trials has grown substantially since pre-registrations have been incorporated.47 While this solution is not perfect and does not fit all types of research questions, we believe that it is a model worth adopting in the exercise and sports science field. </p> <p>In addition to a cultural shift, implementing pre-registration and/or blinded results to peer reviews will be helpful in reducing the frequency of these negative occurrences</p>","Halperin, Israel; Vigotsky, Andrew D.; Foster, Carl; Pyne, David B.","psychology; replicability; replication; methodology; include; registered-reports; crisis; hypothesis; biomarkers; note; muscle protein-synthesis; null results; programs; surrogate end-points"
"<p>We propose that methods from the systems sciences be used to assess the effects, both positive and negative, of proposed solutions to the problem of declining research integrity such as study registration, Registered Reports, and open access to methods and data.</p> <p>Registered Reports entail journals removing the incentive for producing manuscripts with positive results by making a commitment to publish a study based on its methodological quality and rigor, regardless of the nature or direction of the results (Chambers et al. 2014; Nosek and Lakens 2014).</p> <p>The above data pertaining to registered reports illustrates the main problem with procedures that focus on the manner in which research is conducted and data analyzed. Essentially, these beg the question as to why researchers within a specific academic discipline would adopt such practices. Given the existing normative pressures to produce positive results, researchers adopting procedures that reduce the capacity to do this put themselves at a competitive disadvantage to their peers. Also, those who have been successful within a discipline are likely to have achieved this through playing by the established rules of â€˜â€˜publish or perishâ€™â€™. It is unlikely, in the absence of external pressure to do so, that they would suddenly decide to introduce practices for themselves and those they supervise and mentor that would undermine their position of prestige and dominance within a discipline. Much the same applies to journals: why would journal editors put themselves at a competitive disadvantage relative to their peers by making the review process more arduous? One answer to this is that it allows the scientist to conduct higher quality research that is not tainted by selection bias and distorted reporting. Therefore, scientists should want to use this procedure and publish in journals that support registered reports. However, the end product, namely a published manuscript reporting essentially null findings, is, under the current reward systems that prevail in many disciplines, likely to be of less value in advancing a researcherâ€™s career. Thus, registered reports might reasonably be considered to be a procedure that requires greater effort for less reward.</p> <p># Example 3: Production Models</p> <p> A third alternative is to conceptualize the system in terms of an industry (in this case the research industry) that has begun to produce a deficient product (research reports published in academic journals). Such a model would include the drivers described above and could be used to test the solutions discussed in the previous section. We illustrate this model in more detail below by describing a specific system dynamics model of registered reports.</p> <p>The goal of registered reports is to remove the incentive to use flexible data analysis practices by making publication dependent on methodological rigor and not the production of positive results. In order for this practice to have widespread impact on the data analysis and reporting culture of an academic discipline it would have to diffuse through the population of researchers, thereby becoming common practice and improving research quality and integrity. From a systems perspective, the success of such a change in the incentive structure of a discipline will depend on the initial conditions existing within that discipline. These include the relative importance accorded hypothesis testing compared to exploratory research, the number of journals within the discipline, the prestige of journals adopting registered reports, and the flexibility of researchers within the discipline to publish beyond discipline-specific journals not using registered reports. Figure 3 presents a preliminary model of registered reports: the upper path shows the traditional publication process and the lower path the registered reports process. The outputs appear at the right of the figure, in the form of true effect papers (reporting either positive or negative results), true null effect papers, and true manufactured effect papers (i.e., â€˜â€˜positiveâ€™â€™ results produced through flexible data analysis). The goal of any change in the incentive structure is to reduce the publication of manufactured effects and increase the publication of true effects whether these are positive, negative, or null findings. If successful, it should reduce the flow of published papers into the manufactured effect stock. Such a model could be parameterized using data pertaining to peer-review and publication of specific disciplines, such as psychology.  </p> <p>At present, the funding base for empirical research into the the causes of the increased use of questionable data analysis practices in many academic disciplines, as well as funding to undertake and evaluate interventions to curtail their use, is fairly modest. To a large extent, the field has grown as a result of substantial funding (over $81 million since 2011) from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation (2016). The very limited federal funds available are channeled through the Office of Research Integrity, and are only sufficient to support a handful of projects. Given this limited funding, empirical evaluations of proposed solutions such as registered reports and team of rivals could take decades to appear. Moreover, some disciplines may be in a readier state to adopt such interventions while in others they may have little chance of success given the pressure of countervailing influences. As already observed, system dynamics models can be used to assess such initial conditions and conduct virtual experiments that accelerate the dynamics of processes that might take years to unfold in the real world (Sterman 2000).</p>","Gorman, Dennis M.; Elkins, Amber D.; Lawley, Mark","include; note; RRs; blind_analysis; non-empirical_opinion; system_dynamics_models"
"<p>Registered reports entail submitting a studyâ€™s entire introduction and method (including proposed analyses) for peer review and in-principle acceptance before data collection begins (Chambers, 2013).

"<p>We adopted the Registered Report format from the outset (see our launch editorial: https://www. nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0034), and have since received a large number of excellent submissions. This month marks a special milestone in the history of Registered Reports at Nature Human Behaviour, as we are publishing our first two Stage 2 Registered Reports: articles that report on studies that were peer reviewed and accepted in principle before data collection began. When we accepted in principle the Stage 1 versions of these Registered Reports, both we and our reviewers were persuaded that these papers were addressing important questions of broad significance and that they represented the most rigorous efforts to address these questions to date. We committed to publishing these studies before the results were known because we strongly believe that when the question is important and the methods robust, the results will be important no matter what they are.The results of both studies are illuminating: they showcase how the results of meticulously designed, carefully executed studies, for which a commitment to publication was made results-blind, may differ from the type of work we usually see published, which typically presents â€˜cleanâ€™ results that seemingly always confirm the researchersâ€™ primary hypothesis.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>In essence, the first two Registered Reports we are publishing consist of a null result and a result that contradicts the experimental hypothesis. These were obtained through highly powered, rigorously vetted protocols, lending significant credence to the results. The outcomes of our first two published Registered Reports amplify what has become increasingly apparent during the nascent credibility revolution in the social and behavioural sciences: we have to expect scientific results to be contradictory, unpredicted or even messy.</p>","Anonymous","include; note; empirical_case_study; RRs"
"<p>Publication bias is a major issue across most, if not all, scientific disciplines. Editors and reviewers are biased toward positive findings and against null findings and/or those that run counter to norms and expectations in the field. However, research ought to be judged based on sound conceptualization and design and not on the findings themselves....â€œin-principle acceptance,â€ provides the green light for the researchers to conduct the study and is a guarantee of publication so long as the researchers adhere to the approved plan. Thus, acceptance of the paper is based on conceptualization and design and not on the specific pattern of findings. This general approach should sound familiar to many readers, as this is how most institutions in the United States handle studentsâ€™ dissertations (i.e., students propose a dissertation plan that is revised and subsequently approved by a committee).</p> <p>Â </p> <p>At Emerging Adulthood, we are currently processing a special issue (edited by me and Brent Donnellan) consisting of Registered Reports of manuscripts drawn from the second iteration of the Emerging Adulthood Measured at Multiple Institutions project (https://osf.io/te54b/; see Reifman &amp; Grahe, 2016, for details on the first iteration of the project). This process has raised many issues with using this format for nonexperimental research (which we will detail in an introduction to the special issue) but has convinced me of their potential. Accordingly, I am pleased to announce that Emerging Adulthood will now accept Registered Reports as a submission option. For those readers who are serving as editors at other journals, I highly encourage you too do a special issue on Registered Reports prior to committing to the format, largely because I think doing so will allay any trepidation about implementing them.</p>","Syed, Moin","include; announcement_RRs; note; RRs"
