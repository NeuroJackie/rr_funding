Registered Reports Funding/Research Grants
	What
		Combines the Registered Reports publishing model into the process of allocating grant funding as as funders and journals review research protocols simulateously. Successful protocols are offered financial support by the funder and in-principal acceptance for publication. (Does this reflect all the models?)
	Acceptability
		Recognised as an indcator of rigour in REF 2021
		5 existing partnerships

	Preregistration
		Target problems 
			P-hacking, selective outcome reporting & HARKing
				How
					Comparing published article to preregistered protocols can identifying analyses or outcomes are unplanned additions or planned and excluded + any changes to 'tested hypothesis' 
				Efficacy
			Unclear confirmatory & exploratory research
				How
					Can identify which research is planned (confirmatory) or unplanned (exploratory)
				Efficacy

		Barriers
	Results blind peer review
		Impact
		Barriers
	Pre-study peer review
		Impact
			Prevent waste
				How
					Identify methodological flaws before study is conducted
		Barriers
	In principal acceptance
		Impact
			Reduces editorial biases vs results
				How
					Manuscript cannot be rejected based on it's results
			Reduces file drawer
				How
					Report is mostly complete so researchers have already invested time into publishing these results and the remaining effort is reduced.
					Fear of rejection as a reason for not submitting is eliminated
				Moderators
					Public record of reason for withdrawal
						Deincentivises withdrawal based on results as this will be public knowledge if there are negative attitudes towards refusing to publish your research based on their results. 
			Guarentees timely publication
				How
					? (time-lag bias?)
		Barriers
	Funder peer review
		Impact
		Barriers
	Publication peer review
		Impact
		Barriers
	Combining publication and funding decision making
		Impact
			Increase efficiency/reduce waste
				Methodologically questionable research is not funded
					Moderators
						Nothing is stopping these researchers seeking funding elsewhere since rejections are not public (?)
				Reduces burden on reviewers
					How?
				Funder is guarenteed publication of funded research

Crowdsourced RR funding


REF 2021 - "registered reports, pre-registration, publication of data sets, experimental materials, analytic code, and use of reporting checklists for publication purposes and those relating to the use of animals in research. These contribute to the evaluation of rigour for submitted output"
